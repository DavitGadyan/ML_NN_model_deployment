# ML & NN model deployment 

There are several options to deploy ML or NN model to production.
I will consider just two of them:

- Flask API
- Cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure)

Flask is suitable for presentation purposes, whereas Cloud based solutions will be usefull for large scale production (multiple users make predictions etc..)
