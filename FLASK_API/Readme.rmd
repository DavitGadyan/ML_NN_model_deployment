# Flask API

In simple cases for presentation purposes we can use Flask web framework to deploy ML algos. Basically we will use Flask as backend for our 
website and upload model there and just call .predict method on model object.

This assumes that our Flask app is running to be able to get predictions in json format from it.

This is basically what is called REST API.
